// Notes file for Coding Challenge

So I clearly didn't finish the coding challenge. 
I was working on a bug with the switch statements that calculated from decimal to roman and fdrom roman to decimal. 
I think the bug had to do with type casting, but I am unsure.

The next steps I would've taken would be:
1) resolve the bug so the switch statements would return a string or integer as intended
2) flush out the run test function in main so that I could automate the testing of the validating functions as well as the actual conversion functions
3) increase the robust nature of the validateRoman() by rejecting roman values that had invalid ordering of accepted characters
